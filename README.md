# -100-8-dimensional-real-time-plotting
Just an example of real time plotting in a circular fashion in python. Here one program generates 100*8 dimensional random csv file in which each new row comes after every 0.5 seconds and other program reads the csv at the same time and plots the new row as soon as the row is generated.
