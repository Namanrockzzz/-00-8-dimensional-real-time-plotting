# -100-8-dimensional-real-time-plotting-in-circular-fashion
- 'Program for csv file' generates a 100x8 dimensional csv file. After every half second 8 new points are stored. Points keep getting stored untill 100 rows of the csv file are complete.
- 'Program for real time visualization' - plots 8 points at a time i.e 1 point in each graph as soon as a new row is stored in the csv file. Once 100 points are plotted in each graph, the program starts plotting the same points again.
