# -100-8-dimensional-real-time-plotting
Just an example of real time plotting in circular fashion in python.
Here one program generates 100*8 dimensional random csv file in which each new row is generated every 0.5 seconds till 100 rows are complete and other program reads the csv and plots it as soon as new row is generated.
Once 100 rows are plotted it starts plotting the same points and repeats the same process infinitely.
